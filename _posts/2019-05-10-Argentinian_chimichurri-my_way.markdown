Some traditions need to be respected, but some need adjustments.


[Chimichurri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimichurri) was one of them. Usually oily and garlic intense, although still yummy, does not give good constrast to the argentinian beef (which, btw, should always be eaten rare). This is the recipe for what I call '**Katiechurri**', my version of chimichurri with a hint of inspiration from [salsa criolla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salsa_criolla).


## Recipe
* Half onion (red or white)
* Some green onion (green and white stuff)
* One small tomate (no insides) with skin.
* Some red pepper (almost the same as onion). You can also add green or yellow one, but red must be present.
* Parsley, a bunch. May be a bit more than the oregano (once chopped). Use some stems, as they give some bitter taste and crunch.
* Oregano (around 6 soup spoons). Better if u can get fresh one and chop it :)
* One small garlic. Don't get too much garlic on it.
* Salt, as needed. Don't make it salty (meat is already salty)
* Pepper: LOTS!, you can never get too much. Mainly black, but use any color. Not too much white.
* Spice: any u like, as long as it doesnt have a strong taste that would dominate the chimichurri.
* Dry grinded red pepper, 2 tea spoons.
* Cummin: 1 tea spoon, may be less not more.
* Chili peppers: use anything u like, that would blend with the chimichurri. I wouldnt use anything too strong, like habaneros, but never tried.
* Olive oil: 2 soup spoons.
* Vinegar (alcohol one usually): like 12 soup spoons... you should put vinegar until the mixture gets fully soaked.
* Let it rest in the fridge for an hour. Could be less if in a hurry - optional step.


#### TIPS:
* Taste before going to the fridge AND after. Adjust ingredientes as needed. Usually u would add a kick of vinegar, as it is absorbed.
* You can use anything you like on it, as long as you don't let the secondary flavours overtake the 'core' of the chimichurri. Chili peppers, dry tomates, echalottes, etc. Once I did one with lemon to eat a roasted chicken.
* Try to use fresh everything and chop it.
* Add your own twist to the recipe - invent and share!
* Enjoy it with a wine ;)
