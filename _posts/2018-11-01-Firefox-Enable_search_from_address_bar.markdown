Yeah, I know, its enabled by default. But sometimes some organizations block it.

If so, got to the "advanced" configuration by entering "about:config" in the address bar. Look for "**keyword.enabled**" and set it to "true". If its not true, you wont be able to search from the address bar, regardless what you set in FF's preferences.
