Hi! I'm _Supermasita_. 

I was trained as a recording engineer but I work as a system engineer.

This blog was created to collect simple things I want to remember, mainly regarding computers or audio.

If you want to contact me, you can usually find me on Freenode in one of these channels: 
* #pyar
* #kaltura
* #nginx

My code/computers links:
* [Github](https://github.com/supermasita)
* [geoip.supermasita.com](https://geoip.supermasita.com): _A geoip service based on Tornado and Maxmind DB_
* [Kaltura eCDN Grapher](https://dev.supermasita.com/kaltura/keg): _A network grapher for Kaltura's eCDN KES nodes_
* [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/supermasita/)

My music/audio links:
* [ALIAZ](http://aliaz.com.ar): _My hard rock band_
* [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/supermasita): _More music_

This blog uses [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll) with the [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme.
