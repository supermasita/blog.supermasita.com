Hi! I'm _Supermasita_. I was trained as a recording engineer but I work as a systems engineer.

This blog was created to collect simple things I want to remember, mainly regarding computers or audio.

If you want to contact me, you can usually find me on Freenode in one of these channels: #pyar, #kaltura or #nginx .


_BTW: This blog uses [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll) and the [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme._
