Hi! I'm _Supermasita_. 

I was trained as a recording engineer but I work as a systems engineer.

This blog was created to collect simple things I want to remember, mainly regarding computers or audio.

If you want to contact me, you can usually find me on Freenode in one of these channels: 
* #pyar
* #kaltura
* #nginx

Some of my projects:
* [ALIAZ](http://aliaz.com.ar): my hard rock band
* [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/supermasita): more music
* [Github](https://github.com/supermasita)
* [geoip.supermasita.com](https://geoip.supermasita.com): A geoip service based on Tornado and Maxmind DB
* [Kaltura eCDN Grapher](https://dev.supermasita.com/kaltura/keg): A network grapher for Kaltura's eCDN KES nodes
